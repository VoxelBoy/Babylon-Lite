/**
 * ShaderMaterial must honour the floating origin.
 *
 * The bug this exists for: `standard`, `pbr` and `node` renderables all rebase
 * their mesh world matrix onto the camera before upload (via
 * `engine._makePackMeshWorld`), but the ShaderMaterial writers read
 * `mesh.worldMatrix` raw. Under `useFloatingOrigin` the view matrix carries no
 * translation — `getViewMatrix` forces it to zero and expects the mesh pack to
 * have established the eye-relative frame — so an un-rebased mesh is drawn as
 * though the camera sat at the world origin. Its position and apparent size
 * then depend only on where it IS, never on where the viewer is.
 *
 * What that looked like: flying toward a planet, the distance readout counting
 * down, the terrain LOD subdividing correctly — and the planet not growing by a
 * single pixel. The game knew the distance; the renderer did not.
 *
 * It survived every existing test because nothing asserted that a ShaderMaterial
 * mesh's clip-space position depends on the camera's. `floating-origin-upload`
 * covers the packer and the view matrix in isolation; both were fine. The gap
 * was the one renderable family that never called the packer.
 *
 * So the assertions below are framed as approach, not as pack format: move the
 * camera toward a fixed mesh and require what you would see to change. That is
 * the property that was broken, and it fails on the pre-fix writer.
 *
 * LineMaterial is a ShaderMaterial under the skin, so orbit/guide lines were
 * hit by exactly the same defect.
