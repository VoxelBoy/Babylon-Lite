# Module: Shader Material

> Package path: `packages/babylon-lite/src/material/shader/`

## Purpose

The ShaderMaterial module provides Lite's WGSL-only equivalent of Babylon.js `ShaderMaterial`: user-authored vertex and fragment shaders, explicit vertex attribute lists, typed custom uniforms, texture samplers, compile-time defines, and render-state hints such as alpha blending.

This module is intentionally **not** a GLSL compatibility layer. Babylon.js documentation and playgrounds remain useful as reference scenes and API concepts, but Lite accepts WGSL source only. There is no GLSL parser, no GLSL-to-WGSL transpiler, and no `Effect.ShadersStore` global registry in core.

The design follows the Lite material contract:

- A ShaderMaterial is plain data with a material-owned `_buildGroup`.
- The scene never knows about shader-specific details.
- The renderer only binds group 0 and asks renderables to draw.
- The material owns shader source, bind group layouts, pipelines, bind groups, and resource lifetime.
- Structured GPU layout comes from typed options, never by parsing emitted WGSL.

## Public API Surface

### Factory

```typescript
export function createShaderMaterial(options: ShaderMaterialOptions): ShaderMaterial;
export function enableShaderMaterialInstanceWorld(material: ShaderMaterial): void;
export function enableShaderMaterialFinalColor(material: ShaderMaterial): void;
export function setShaderAttributeFormats(material: ShaderMaterial, formats: ShaderAttributeFormats): void;
```

`createShaderMaterial` is synchronous and accepts already-resolved WGSL source strings.

```typescript
export interface ShaderMaterialOptions {
    readonly name?: string;
    readonly vertexSource: string;
    readonly fragmentSource: string;
    readonly attributes: readonly ShaderAttributeName[];
    readonly uniforms?: readonly ShaderUniformOption[];
    readonly samplers?: readonly ShaderSamplerOption[];
    readonly defines?: ShaderDefineMap;
    /** Bind/inject the mesh's optional thin-instance RGBA stream for this material. Default true. */
    readonly useThinInstanceColors?: boolean;
    readonly needAlphaBlending?: boolean;
    readonly blendMode?: "alpha" | "additive";
    readonly blend?: GPUBlendState;
    readonly needAlphaTesting?: boolean;
    readonly backFaceCulling?: boolean;
    readonly depthWrite?: boolean;
    readonly depthCompare?: GPUCompareFunction;
    readonly topology?: "point-list" | "line-list" | "triangle-list";
}
```

Supported Babylon route forms:

| Babylon route form                                | Lite phase 1 handling                                                                                         |

| `{ vertex, fragment }` with `Effect.ShadersStore` | Not supported in core; global shader stores violate Lite's no-side-effect rule.                               |
| `{ vertexElement, fragmentElement }`              | Not supported in core. Callers may read DOM text and pass WGSL strings explicitly.                            |
| `"./COMMON_NAME"` external `.fx` files            | Not supported in core. A future helper may fetch WGSL explicitly, but the material factory stays synchronous. |

### Material type

```typescript
export interface ShaderMaterial extends Material {
    readonly name?: string;
    readonly vertexSource: string;
    readonly fragmentSource: string;
    readonly attributes: readonly ShaderAttributeName[];
    readonly uniformDecls: readonly ShaderUniformDecl[];
    readonly samplerDecls: readonly ShaderSamplerDecl[];
    readonly defines: readonly ShaderDefine[];
    readonly needAlphaBlending: boolean;
    readonly blendMode: "alpha" | "additive";
    readonly blend?: GPUBlendState;
    readonly needAlphaTesting: boolean;
    readonly backFaceCulling: boolean;
    readonly depthWrite: boolean;
    readonly depthCompare: GPUCompareFunction;
    _uniformValues: Map<string, ShaderUniformSlot>;
    _textureSlots: Map<string, ShaderTextureSlot>;
    _uniformVersion: number;
    _resourceVersion: number;
}
```

`_uboVersion` from the base `Material` mirrors `_uniformVersion` for compatibility with existing dirty tracking. `_resourceVersion` is separate because texture/sampler changes require bind group rebuilds, not just UBO writes.

`blend` is an explicit color-target blend-state override. When present, it replaces the state derived from `blendMode`, implies `needAlphaBlending` unless explicitly overridden, defaults `depthWrite` to `false`, and participates in the cross-material pipeline-cache key.

`topology` defaults to `triangle-list`. It is fixed when the material is created and participates
in pipeline selection; callers supplying line-list geometry can use `"line-list"` for diagnostic
wireframe rendering without accessing internal pipeline state. Indexed strip topologies are rejected
because WebGPU requires a `stripIndexFormat` matching each mesh's index buffer, while ShaderMaterial
pipeline grouping is material-based.

### Attributes

```typescript
export type ShaderAttributeName = "position" | "normal" | "uv" | "uv2" | "tangent" | "color" | "joints" | "weights" | "joints1" | "weights1";
export type ShaderAttributeFormats = Partial<Record<ShaderAttributeName, GPUVertexFormat>>;
```

The order in `options.attributes` is the vertex buffer binding order and the WGSL `@location` order. Unsupported names throw during material creation. Missing optional mesh buffers use zero-filled buffers. When `enableShaderMaterialFinalColor()` is enabled, its missing `color` fallback is instead white so color multiplication does not black out meshes without vertex colors. `position` is required for normal mesh rendering.

`setShaderAttributeFormats` changes the material-owned vertex signature before registration or pipeline preparation: the declared
`GPUVertexFormat` selects both the generated WGSL input type and the tight default stride. Mesh-owned
`MeshGPU._vbLayout` supplies per-attribute stride/offset packing independently. The same material can
draw ordinary tight geometry and storage-backed slabs only when their physical formats are compatible.
Canonical CPU/glTF geometry retains its canonical encodings (for example, XYZ positions use
`float32x3`); declaring `float32x4` does not repack those buffers. Such mismatches are rejected during
renderable construction. Noncanonical formats are supported on matching storage-backed streams;
their offset alignment and byte extent must fit the declared stride. Format declarations are
snapshotted by the setter, and storage-backed constant-zero streams remain valid for all supported formats.
Packed variants participate in sync,
async, cross-material, depth/normal-view, and thin-instance pipeline keys. Storage-backed draws preserve
the mesh's `_baseVertex`, and absent optional slab streams use the shared zero-stride default buffer.
Mesh-specific layouts reuse the binding's resolved formats and change only stride/offset, rather
than rebuilding the material signature for every mesh.

The storage/format opt-in installs one synchronous support record in `shader-vb-support.ts`. That small
module owns shared canonical format/type/stride metadata and the attribute layout helper, while
the renderable passes its authored-stream lookup to the optional support callbacks. Importing
`setShaderAttributeFormats` or constructing storage geometry therefore does not
statically pull the full lazy `shader-pipeline.ts` / `shader-renderable.ts` implementation into the entry
module. Direct draws pass `baseVertex` to WebGPU without a forwarding wrapper. Thin-instance paths
resolve their combined vertex layouts once during construction and share them across binding and
async preparation; indirect argument encoding remains in `mesh-indexed-indirect.ts`.

The interleaved glTF loader installs the same resolver when it creates a strided mesh.
PBR, Standard, and picking consume that mesh packing directly; installing the resolver
also makes plain and thin-instance ShaderMaterial draws use the recorded stride and
per-attribute offsets. The loader's normalized COLOR_0 stream remains a separate tight
float32x4 buffer, while attributes that stay interleaved retain their authored packing.
Vertex-format support is needed only when preparing layouts and grouping packets; renderable draw
closures do not retain it. Missing-buffer allocation calls the engine-owned seam directly.
With the final-color helper enabled, missing storage-backed color inputs use one mesh-owned
white float32 RGBA record with zero stride. Its physical fallback format is canonical float32x4,
including when the authored color declaration uses a normalized format, so the neutral value
remains white. The buffer is released with the last geometry owner; ordinary missing streams
still use their existing zero defaults.
Validation computes each mesh's missing-stream mask once before packet allocation. Packets retain
that mask for grouping and layout resolution, avoiding repeated stream scans. Opaque and transparent
renderables share target-binding construction, while retaining their distinct ordering and update behavior.
Default GPU picking supports compatible float32 components only. A material's incompatible position
or requested discard-data format produces an explicit picking error; callers may exclude that mesh
with `mesh.pickable = false`, a filter, or an ignore entry.

### Thin instances and GPU culling

A ShaderMaterial mesh can be hardware-instanced via the standard thin-instance API (`setThinInstances`, `setThinInstanceColors`, `enableThinInstanceGpuCulling` — see `12-thin-instances.md`). No new ShaderMaterial option is required: when a mesh has `thinInstances`, the renderer builds a per-mesh **instance pipeline variant** and auto-injects extra attributes into the generated `VertexInput` struct, appended after the declared attributes (so at `@location(attributes.length)` onward):

```wgsl
@location(N)   world0: vec4<f32>,   // instance world matrix columns
@location(N+1) world1: vec4<f32>,
@location(N+2) world2: vec4<f32>,
@location(N+3) world3: vec4<f32>,
@location(N+4) instanceColor: vec4<f32>,   // only when setThinInstanceColors() was called
```

`useThinInstanceColors` controls whether this particular ShaderMaterial draw consumes the mesh's optional
RGBA stream. It defaults to `true`, preserving the automatic behaviour above. When set to `false`, the
instanced variant still injects and binds `world0..world3`, but it does not inject `instanceColor`, bind or
GPU-cull a color buffer, or synchronize colors for that draw. The mesh's `ThinInstanceData.colors` remains
intact, so another material rendering the same mesh can still consume it.

The option is specifically valid for sampler-free depth/material overrides: a visible material may consume
per-instance tint while its `_shadowCasterMaterial` uses `{ useThinInstanceColors: false }`. Both draws then
share the mesh's one matrix buffer, while the caster avoids an unused color vertex stream. The override WGSL
must not reference `input.instanceColor`. The option is ignored for non-instanced meshes.

Call `enableShaderMaterialInstanceWorld(material)` before `registerScene()` to opt one material into a
generated `getFinalWorld(input: VertexInput)` helper. The helper has one stable signature for both regular
and thin-instanced meshes:

```wgsl
let finalWorld = getFinalWorld(input);
out.position = shaderSystem.viewProjection * finalWorld * vec4<f32>(input.position, 1.0);
// out.vColor = input.instanceColor;  // when instance colors are present
```

For a regular mesh, `getFinalWorld` returns `shaderSystem.world`. For a thin-instanced mesh, it returns
`shaderSystem.world * mat4x4<f32>(input.world0, input.world1, input.world2, input.world3)`. This lets one
vertex source serve both mesh types without referencing instance-only attributes on the regular-mesh variant.
The `"world"` system uniform must be present in `ShaderMaterialOptions.uniforms`; the enabler throws otherwise.
Materials that do not call the enabler retain the original generated prelude and pull in none of the helper WGSL
or material-tracking implementation.

The `world` system uniform stays the **mesh** world matrix. The baked `worldViewProjection` / `worldView`
system uniforms are **not** instance-aware — shared regular/instanced shaders must use `viewProjection` and
`getFinalWorld(input)`.

Call `enableShaderMaterialFinalColor(material)` before `registerScene()` to opt one material into a generated
`getFinalColor(input: VertexInput)` helper:

```wgsl
out.vColor = getFinalColor(input);
```

The generated implementation returns white when the material declares no color attribute and the pipeline has
no instance-color stream, `input.color` for vertex color only, `input.instanceColor` for instance color only,
and `input.color * input.instanceColor` when both are present. `input.color` remains the ordinary mesh
per-vertex attribute requested through `attributes: ["color"]`; `setThinInstanceColors()` supplies the separate
instance-rate `input.instanceColor`. When a material declares `color` but a mesh has no vertex-color buffer,
`input.color` uses a mesh-owned neutral white fallback, so an available instance color passes through
unchanged. The fallback participates in normal shared-geometry disposal, resize retirement, and device recovery.

Like `getFinalWorld`, the final-color helper is emitted only for materials that opt in. The instance-color
specialization is selected from the bound vertex-buffer layout rather than from a pipeline-key naming
convention or by parsing generated WGSL.

Implementation notes (bundle discipline):

- The instance vertex-buffer layouts, the prelude attribute lines, and the per-mesh instanced renderable live in `material/shader/shader-thin-instance.ts`, **dynamically imported** via `shader-group-builder.ts` → `buildShaderGroup` only when `meshes.some(m => m.thinInstances)`. Non-instanced ShaderMaterial scenes route through the unchanged synchronous `buildShaderMaterialRenderables`.
- The expensive bindings (`group1BGL`, `systemSpec`, `customSpec`) are shared between the non-instanced and instanced variants — instancing is vertex data, not bind groups. Only the vertex buffer layouts and the `VertexInput` struct differ, so `getOrCreateShaderPipeline()` keys instanced pipelines on a compact non-empty variant suffix (`0` or `1`). The color bit is `1` only when the mesh has colors and the material did not opt out through `useThinInstanceColors`.
- Instanced ShaderMaterial meshes render as **one `_direct` renderable per mesh** (not merged), so per-mesh instance buffers are re-bound fresh each frame (avoiding stale render-bundle references when instance capacity grows).
- **Opt-in GPU frustum culling** is wired via the shared `mesh/thin-instance-cull-binding.ts` helper (same as Standard/PBR): when `enableThinInstanceGpuCulling(mesh)` is set, the compute cull pass runs in the binding `update()` and the draw becomes `drawIndexedIndirect`. Opaque instanced ShaderMaterial only; transparent instanced meshes use the normal (non-culled) instanced draw.

### Uniform declarations

```typescript
export type ShaderUniformType = "f32" | "u32" | "i32" | "vec2<f32>" | "vec3<f32>" | "vec4<f32>" | "mat4x4<f32>";

export type ShaderSystemUniformName = "world" | "view" | "projection" | "viewProjection" | "worldView" | "worldViewProjection" | "cameraPosition" | "screenSize" | "alphaCutoff";

export type ShaderUniformOption = ShaderSystemUniformName | ShaderUniformDecl;

export interface ShaderUniformDecl {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly type: ShaderUniformType;
    readonly defaultValue?: number | readonly number[];
}
```

String uniforms are only accepted for known Babylon-style system uniforms. Custom uniforms must include a type. This keeps the Babylon `uniforms: ["worldViewProjection", "time"]` concept where safe, while rejecting ambiguous custom strings like `"time"` unless the caller provides `{ name: "time", type: "f32" }`.

### Sampler declarations

```typescript
export type ShaderSamplerOption = string | ShaderSampler2DDecl | ShaderSampler3DDecl;

/** Flat or layered: texture_2d<f32>, texture_2d_array<f32>, or their depth forms. */
export interface ShaderSampler2DDecl {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly sampleType?: "float" | "unfilterable-float" | "depth";
    readonly viewDimension?: "2d" | "2d-array";
    readonly comparison?: boolean;
}

/** Volume: texture_3d<f32>. Bind a Texture3D and sample with a vec3<f32> coordinate. */
export interface ShaderSampler3DDecl {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly sampleType?: "float" | "unfilterable-float";
    readonly viewDimension: "3d";
    readonly comparison?: false;
}
```

Each sampler name maps to a pair of WGSL bindings:

```wgsl
@group(1) @binding(N) var textureSampler: texture_2d<f32>;
@group(1) @binding(N + 1) var textureSamplerSampler: sampler;
```

The texture type follows `viewDimension`, and the bind-group-layout entry is created with that same
dimension, so the declaration is the single place a sampler's shape is stated:

| `viewDimension` | WGSL texture type      | depth form               |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `"2d"` (default) | `texture_2d<f32>`      | `texture_depth_2d`       |
| `"2d-array"`    | `texture_2d_array<f32>` | `texture_depth_2d_array` |
| `"3d"`          | `texture_3d<f32>`      | — (none exists in WGSL)  |

`comparison: true` emits `sampler_comparison` and implies a depth texture; otherwise the sampler is
`filtering` for `float` and `non-filtering` for `unfilterable-float`. Because WGSL has no
`texture_depth_3d`, a `"3d"` sampler is never a depth or comparison sampler — `ShaderSampler3DDecl`
makes that pairing a type error rather than a WebGPU validation failure at pipeline creation. That
constraint is deliberately carried by the type rather than a runtime check: a `throw` here was
measured at +62 bytes in every ShaderMaterial scene and, because a new `throw` renumbers every later
`lite-error` code, +5 bytes in scenes containing no ShaderMaterial at all.

Public APIs accept `Texture2D` only, never raw GPU handles; `Texture2DArray` and `Texture3D` are
`Texture2D` subtypes carrying their own view dimension, so they bind through the same
`setShaderTexture` path.

### Defines

```typescript
export type ShaderDefineValue = boolean | number;
export type ShaderDefineMap = Readonly<Record<string, ShaderDefineValue>>;

export interface ShaderDefine {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly value: ShaderDefineValue;
}
```

WGSL has no preprocessor. Lite converts defines to const declarations in the generated prelude:

```wgsl
const MyDefine: bool = true;
const Scale: f32 = 2.0;
```

The normalized define set is part of the pipeline cache key. Callers write ordinary WGSL `if (MyDefine) { ... }`; the WGSL compiler can constant-fold the branch. `#define`, `#ifdef`, and string macro replacement are not supported.

### Setters

```typescript
export type ShaderUniformValue = number | readonly number[] | Float32Array;

export function setShaderUniform(material: ShaderMaterial, name: string, value: ShaderUniformValue): void;
export function setShaderTexture(material: ShaderMaterial, name: string, texture: Texture2D | null): void;
export function enableShaderMaterialUniformCaching(): void;
export function enableShaderUniformRangeUpdates(scene: SceneContext, material: ShaderMaterial): void;
```

`setShaderUniform` validates that the name exists, the declared type is custom or settable, and the supplied float count matches the declaration. It increments `_uniformVersion` and `_uboVersion`.

`enableShaderMaterialUniformCaching` is a process-wide opt-in for scenes with many ShaderMaterials. It caches each
material's system/custom UBO layout and typed-array views, and serializes only custom uniform slots whose setter
version changed. Call it before scene registration. Scenes that do not opt in retain the compact default serializer
and do not include the caching implementation in their bundle.

`enableShaderUniformRangeUpdates` is an opt-in for materials with large custom UBOs and one or a few animated
values. After the custom UBO has been packed once, each changed custom value is written directly into the
material's retained packed `ArrayBuffer`. The opt-in updater widens one pending byte range across all changes made
before the next frame, then uploads only that 4-byte-aligned range through `queue.writeBuffer` from a scene
before-render callback. The first upload and every packed-buffer recreation
remain whole-buffer writes. System uniforms have no custom offset and therefore produce no custom-UBO upload.
Enabling is idempotent per scene, and the same material may be registered with multiple scenes.
Materials that do not opt in keep the original renderable-owned whole-buffer path and pull in zero range-update
implementation bytes.

`setShaderTexture` validates that the sampler exists and tracks both the `Texture2D | null` identity
and the view/sampler captured by the bind group. It increments `_resourceVersion` when either the
facade or those resources change. This keeps ordinary repeated sets allocation-free while allowing a
surface RTT resize callback to pass the same stable facade again and rebuild against its replacement
attachment. The renderable rebuilds the group-1 bind group when the resource version changes.

Convenience wrappers may be added if they stay small and tree-shakable:

```typescript
export function setShaderFloat(material: ShaderMaterial, name: string, value: number): void;
export function setShaderVector3(material: ShaderMaterial, name: string, value: readonly [number, number, number]): void;
export function setShaderMatrix(material: ShaderMaterial, name: string, value: Float32Array): void;
```

The core implementation should route all wrappers through `setShaderUniform`.

## WGSL Authoring Contract

User WGSL must define complete vertex and fragment entry points. Lite does not rewrite entry point bodies.

Recommended entry point names are `mainVertex` and `mainFragment`, but options may later expose entry point names if needed. Phase 1 can require:

```wgsl
@vertex
fn mainVertex(input: VertexInput) -> VertexOutput { ... }

@fragment
fn mainFragment(input: VertexOutput) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> { ... }
```

Lite prepends a generated prelude before user source:

1. `SceneUniforms` from the shared scene group (`@group(0) @binding(0)`).
2. `ShaderSystemUniforms` for requested per-mesh system values (`@group(1) @binding(0)`).
3. Optional `ShaderUniforms` for custom uniforms (`@group(1) @binding(1)`).
4. Texture/sampler declarations for `options.samplers`.
5. WGSL const declarations for `options.defines`.
6. `VertexInput` generated from `options.attributes`.
7. Opt-in `getFinalWorld(input)` and `getFinalColor(input)` helpers, specialized for the active pipeline variant.

User WGSL must not declare:

- `@group(0)` bindings.
- `@group(1)` bindings using names generated by the material.
- `struct VertexInput` unless an option explicitly opts out of generated input.
- Duplicate uniform, sampler, or define identifiers.

Generated names intentionally match the names listed in the options where possible:

- System matrix fields are available as `shaderSystem.world`, `shaderSystem.worldViewProjection`, etc.
- Custom uniforms are available as `shaderUniforms.time`, `shaderUniforms.direction`, etc.
- Texture samplers are available as `<name>` and `<name>Sampler`.
- Scene fields remain available through `scene.viewProjection`, `scene.view`, `scene.vEyePosition`, etc.

## Internal Architecture

### File manifest

```text
packages/babylon-lite/src/material/shader/
  shader-material.ts       Public types, factory, setters, validation.
  shader-material-view-gpu.ts  Terminal private view-UBO retirement.
  enable-shader-material-instance-world.ts  Opt-in regular/thin-instance final-world helper.
  enable-shader-material-final-color.ts  Opt-in effective vertex/instance color helper.
  shader-group-builder.ts  MeshGroupBuilder entry point and lazy renderable import.
  shader-renderable.ts     Per-scene/per-mesh renderables, UBO writes, bind groups.
  shader-pipeline.ts       Generated prelude, BGL creation, pipeline lookup.

  shader-vb-support.ts     Tiny opt-in seam and canonical attribute layouts.
  shader-vb.ts             Declared formats, per-mesh packing, grouping, bounded defaults.
```

### Group builder

Every material returned by `createShaderMaterial` sets `_buildGroup` to `shaderGroupBuilder`.

```typescript
export const shaderGroupBuilder: MeshGroupBuilder = async (scene, meshes) => {
    const { buildShaderMaterialRenderables } = await import("./shader-renderable.js");
    const result = buildShaderMaterialRenderables(scene, meshes);
    shaderGroupBuilder._rebuildSingle = result.rebuildSingle;
    return result;
};
```

The group builder has no module-level registry and imports renderable code only when a scene actually uses ShaderMaterial.

### Per-material grouping

`buildShaderMaterialRenderables(scene, meshes)` groups meshes by `ShaderMaterial` instance. Each material instance owns:

- Normalized source strings.
- Normalized attributes.
- Normalized uniform/sampler/define declarations.
- Pipeline variant cache for target signatures.
- One custom UBO per material if custom uniforms exist.
- Per-texture slots and resource version.

Opaque ShaderMaterials may batch multiple meshes under one renderable if they share one material instance and target pipeline. Transparent ShaderMaterials should emit one renderable per mesh so frame-graph sorting can use each mesh world center.

A merged opaque renderable has no single source mesh for the frame graph to visibility-filter. Its render-bundle recording loop must therefore skip each packet whose mesh has
`visible === false`; steady-state per-frame updates remain unchanged.

### Pipeline cache

Cache scope is per material instance, not module-level. Cross-material pipeline sharing is a non-goal for phase 1 because module-level `Map` allocations violate Lite's tree-shaking guidance. A future device-owned cache may be added if profiling proves it necessary.

The cache key includes:

- Vertex WGSL source.
- Fragment WGSL source.
- Generated prelude key.
- Attribute list/order.
- Uniform layout.
- Sampler layout.
- Define set.
- Alpha/depth/cull state.
- Render target signature: color format, depth/stencil format, sample count, flipY.
- Thin-instance variant: matrix stream present and whether this material consumes the optional color stream.

### Bind group layout

The pipeline layout is:

| Group | Owner                   | Bindings                                            |
| ----- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Frame graph render task | `SceneUniforms`, scene lights UBO                   |
| 1     | ShaderMaterial          | system UBO, optional custom UBO, textures, samplers |

Group 1 binding order:

1. `ShaderSystemUniforms` at binding 0. Always present so the layout is stable.
2. `ShaderUniforms` at binding 1 if custom uniform declarations exist.
3. Texture/sampler pairs in declaration order.

### UBO layout

Use `computeUboLayout()` from `src/shader/ubo-layout.ts`. Do not split WGSL strings or parse user shader source.

`ShaderSystemUniforms` contains only requested per-mesh values:

| Uniform               | Type          | Source                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `world`               | `mat4x4<f32>` | `mesh.worldMatrix`                                       |
| `worldView`           | `mat4x4<f32>` | `view * world` in Lite matrix convention                 |
| `worldViewProjection` | `mat4x4<f32>` | `scene.viewProjection * world` in Lite matrix convention |
| `projection`          | `mat4x4<f32>` | active pass camera projection                            |
| `screenSize`          | `vec2<f32>`   | active pass target width/height                          |
| `alphaCutoff`         | `f32`         | material/system value, default `0.4`                     |

Scene-level values should be aliased or read from group 0 rather than copied per mesh when possible:

| Uniform          | Preferred source         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `view`           | `scene.view`             |
| `viewProjection` | `scene.viewProjection`   |
| `cameraPosition` | `scene.vEyePosition.xyz` |

If a caller requests the Babylon-style `viewProjection` string, the generated prelude may expose an alias function or const-like local expression in helper code, but it should not allocate a duplicate per-mesh UBO slot.

### Matrix convention

Lite's camera helper computes `viewProjection` as `projection * view`, and material templates currently multiply clip positions by `scene.viewProjection * worldPosition` according to existing engine conventions. ShaderMaterial must use the same convention so it matches Standard, PBR, and NodeMaterial.

### Floating origin

Under LWR (`35-large-world-rendering.md`) the frame the system uniforms describe is **eye-relative, not absolute**. `getViewMatrix` forces the view translation to zero on a floating-origin camera because it expects the mesh world to have already been rebased; Standard, PBR and Node renderables do that in their mesh-world pack, and ShaderMaterial does it in `_shaderWorldMatrix(mesh, camera, out?)`, which both the default and the cached uniform writers call.

Consequences a shader author sees:

- `world`, `worldView` and `worldViewProjection` all carry the camera-relative translation. They derive from one rebased matrix, so they stay in a single frame.
- `cameraPosition` is `(0, 0, 0)` — in the frame `world` is expressed in, the camera _is_ the origin. This keeps the documented `scene.vEyePosition.xyz` equivalence above, which `_packSceneUniforms` already zeroes under FO. An expression like `cameraPosition - worldPos` therefore still yields the correct eye-relative vector, and now at full precision. **This is a breaking change** for any custom shader that read `cameraPosition` as an absolute world-space position while `useFloatingOrigin` was enabled — see the release notes for the migration path.
- Absolute world coordinates are not recoverable from the UBO. A shader that genuinely needs them should take them as a custom uniform.

With floating origin off, every value above is the plain absolute one and the path is copy-free.

`_shaderWorldMatrix`'s third parameter, `out`, is optional and exists only so tests and other direct callers can supply their own destination instead of reusing the module-scoped FO scratch buffer — without it, two calls in a row alias the same array, and the second overwrites the first. The two renderable writers above never pass it, so they keep the original copy-free behaviour: the shared scratch under FO, `mesh.worldMatrix` returned by reference when FO is off. When `out` **is** given, both branches write into it (including the FO-off case, which would otherwise return `mesh.worldMatrix` unchanged) so passing `out` always means "the answer is here."

## Pipeline Configuration

Defaults match normal Lite mesh rendering:

```typescript
primitive.topology = "triangle-list";
primitive.frontFace = target.flipY ? "cw" : "ccw";
primitive.cullMode = options.backFaceCulling === false ? "none" : "back";
depthStencil.format = target.depthStencilFormat ?? "depth24plus-stencil8";
depthStencil.depthCompare = options.depthCompare ?? "greater-equal";
depthStencil.depthWriteEnabled = options.needAlphaBlending ? false : (options.depthWrite ?? true);
multisample.count = target.sampleCount;
```

Alpha blending:

```typescript
if (needAlphaBlending) {
    blend.color = { srcFactor: "src-alpha", dstFactor: "one-minus-src-alpha", operation: "add" };
    blend.alpha = { srcFactor: "one", dstFactor: "one-minus-src-alpha", operation: "add" };
}
```

Alpha testing:

- `needAlphaTesting` does not auto-inject fragment code.
- The shader must explicitly call `discard`.
- If the shader wants an engine-provided cutoff value, it lists `"alphaCutoff"` in `uniforms` and reads `shaderSystem.alphaCutoff`.

## Shader Logic Outline

The simplest WGSL equivalent of the Babylon docs' basic ShaderMaterial:

```wgsl
struct VertexOutput {
    @builtin(position) position: vec4<f32>,
};

@vertex
fn mainVertex(input: VertexInput) -> VertexOutput {
    var out: VertexOutput;
    out.position = shaderSystem.worldViewProjection * vec4<f32>(input.position, 1.0);
    return out;
}

@fragment
fn mainFragment(input: VertexOutput) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    return vec4<f32>(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

The texture sampler equivalent:

```wgsl
struct VertexOutput {
    @builtin(position) position: vec4<f32>,
    @location(0) uv: vec2<f32>,
};

@vertex
fn mainVertex(input: VertexInput) -> VertexOutput {
    var out: VertexOutput;
    out.position = shaderSystem.worldViewProjection * vec4<f32>(input.position, 1.0);
    out.uv = input.uv;
    return out;
}

@fragment
fn mainFragment(input: VertexOutput) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    return textureSample(textureSampler, textureSamplerSampler, input.uv);
}
```

## State Machine / Lifecycle

1. User calls `createShaderMaterial(options)`.
2. Factory validates attributes, normalizes uniform/sampler/define declarations, creates value slots, and attaches `_buildGroup`.
3. User assigns the material to meshes and adds them to the scene.
4. `registerScene` runs deferred builders; `shaderGroupBuilder` dynamically imports `shader-renderable.ts`.
5. Renderable builder groups meshes by material instance.
6. For each material, `shader-pipeline.ts` builds a generated prelude, shader module, group-1 BGL, and render pipeline for the active target signature.
7. For each mesh, the renderable prepares the CPU system-uniform image, uses `createUniformBuffer` to allocate and upload it transactionally, then registers packet cleanup before creating group 1. The allocation label is preserved, and a failed initial upload destroys the unpublished buffer.
8. Each frame, `DrawBinding.update(context)` refreshes system UBOs when world/camera/target data changes and custom UBOs when `_uboVersion` changes.
9. Draw binds vertex buffers in material attribute order, sets index buffer and group 1, then issues an indexed draw with the mesh's optional storage-allocation `_baseVertex`.
10. If `setShaderTexture` changes a texture, the next update recreates group 1 for affected mesh packets and updates acquired/released texture references.
11. Material swaps use `shaderGroupBuilder._rebuildSingle`, matching Standard/PBR.

Auxiliary rebuilds receive an explicit `MeshRebuildResources` lifetime sink instead of registering
their packet in scene-owned disposer maps. Storage-buffer allocations remain owned by their
`StorageBuffer` and engine registration; packets bind the live validated handle but do not maintain
a second, unread raw-buffer list. Disposing a shader packet releases its system UBO and texture
leases without disposing caller-owned storage allocations.

`releaseMaterialViewGpu(engine: EngineContext, view: MaterialView): void` closes an abandoned
ShaderMaterial view's own custom UBO. Detach every draw using that view first; this is terminal
abandonment, not a suspension/resume API. A source material or a view borrowing its source's UBO
is a no-op. The pipeline owner captures the exact owned buffer and its allocating engine, clears
the private CPU/UBO state synchronously, and queues its destruction through `retireGpuResources`.
Repeated calls before or after the queue fence do not destroy again. Shared bindings, shader
modules, source uniforms, textures and storage buffers are untouched.

Pipeline context renewal also retires a view's previous owned custom UBO before replacing its state.
Source-material cleanup is outside this view-abandonment API.
The allocation records its engine, so renewal on another engine retires through the old engine's
queue. Packet updates recreate a missing custom UBO and compare the actually bound buffer with
the current one, in addition to resource revision, before drawing. Plain, transparent and
thin-instance packets consume this same update path. Device recovery still owns rebuilding all
other device-bound packet resources; this rule alone is not a complete packet recovery API.

The focused lifetime tests use real material/view factories and packet writers with inert GPU
buffers: source plus three private views, fenced/idempotent release, borrowed-view safety,
generation renewal and a changed allocating engine. They inspect submitted bytes and bindings;
they do not measure rendered pixels, VRAM or browser performance.

Packet ownership is independent of material-override identity: a supplied resource sink owns an
auxiliary packet; without one, the packet belongs to the scene's main mesh disposer list. Plain
and thin-instance builders forward the same sink. The override flag only controls material
identity guards while updating and drawing, not a second scene-owned auxiliary registry.

Implementation should add lab scenes using the next available scene IDs, plus parity specs and bundle-size ceilings. The BJS side may use Babylon `ShaderMaterial` with GLSL from the docs; the Lite side must use equivalent WGSL and the new Lite `ShaderMaterial`.

Final agent-allowed validation for implementation:

```powershell
pnpm run lint:fix
pnpm run lint
pnpm test
git diff tests/lite/parity/bundle-size.spec.ts
git diff reference/lite/
```

Do not run `pnpm test:perf`.
